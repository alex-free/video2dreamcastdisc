<h1>Video2DreamcastDisc</h1>

<p>By Alex Free</a>

<p>Video2DreamcastDisc is a complete <a href="#bundled">suite of programs</a> that can <b><i>automagically</i> convert any video file</b> to a <code>.iso</code> file (which autoplays your video on the Sega Dreamcast) which can be burned and then booted with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_bootdisk>Utopia Boot Disc</a>.</p>

<p>How it works:</p>
<ul><li>Burn the <code>Utopia CD Loader V1.2.cdi</code> file in the <a href="#downloads">Video2DreamcastDisc directory</a> to a CD-R.</li>
<li>Drop the media file you want to play on the Sega Dreamcast on the <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> file in the release, a <code>video.iso</code> file will be generated. Burn the <code>video.iso</code> file with a CD-R writing program (like <a href=https://www.imgburn.com/>imgburn</a>, <a href=http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>cdrdao</a>, <a href=http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/private/cdrecord.html>cdrecord</a>, etc.). <b>do not use Windows Explorer</b>.</li>
<li>Boot the Sega Dreamcast with the Utopia Boot Disc CD-R burned previously. Once the reindeer appears swap the <code>Utopia CD Loader V1.2.cdi</code> CD-R with the <code>video.iso</code> CD-R.</li>
<li>Close the lid, the video will autoplay. When done, <b>turn the Sega Dreamcast off</b> before removing the <code>video.iso</code> CD-R.</li></ul>

<p>For more info on using the <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> script, see the <a href="#usage">Usage</a> section.</p>

<a name="usage"><h2>Usage</h2></a>

<p>Video2DreamcastDisc provides the <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> script in each release, which performs all operations. This script accepts only one argument. You can either:</p>

<ul><li>Drag n' drop a video file into the <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> file to start converting the dropped file (recommended method).</li>
<li>Open <code>cmd.exe</code>, and execute <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> with an argument like <code>vid2dcd.bat myhuge.mkv</code>.</li></ul>

<p>When executing the <code>vid2dcd.bat</code> with a media file as argument as explained in the above 2 methods, you will be prompted in the <code>cmd.exe</code> window for your desired video bitrate. This does not effect the audio in your final video played on the Sega Dreamcast. The maximum video bitrate you can enter that will actually play on the Sega Dreamcast is <code>3600</code>. This looks great, but it takes up quite a bit of space. You can only overburn so much to a CD-R, so if you find that using <code>3600</code> generates to big of a <code>.iso</code> for you to burn on your CD-R media you should use a lower value. I  recommend not using anything lower then <code>1100</code>, but the choice is yours for the size/length of playback tradeoff</p>

<a name="faq"><h2>FAQ</h2></a>

<p>Q: Why does this not make a <code>.cdi</code> and instead makes an <code>.iso</code>/why does this not make self-booting Sega Dreamcast Discs?</p>
<p>A: This uses the SFD_Player Sega Dreamcast program which was released in 2000 before self-booting Sega Dreamcast Discs other then the Utopia Boot Disc became a thing.</p>

<p>Q: Well now we know how to make self-booting Sega Dreamcast discs, can't you just update the SFD_Player with BootDreams or something?</p>
<p>A: Tried that, doesn't work. It self-boots right into a white void that never plays your video. Rumor has it that this SFD_Player is actually hacked out of an existing executable from a game, and has been modified to act as a homebrew thing. Maybe this is why standard scrambling of <code>1ST_READ.BIN</code> does not work for SFD_Player.</p>

<p>Q: What video track bitrate do I want?</p>
<p>A: If you want the maximum quality your Sega Dreamcast can offer, use 3600. If you can't fit your video.iso file Video2DreamcastDisc generated onto a CD-R with a 3600 bitrate, try converting at 3000, or 2600, or even 1100 for alot more video play time. The lower the video bitrate, the longer your video can be while still fitting on a CD-R.</p>

<p>Q: What is the audio like in videos? Can I change it?</p>
<p>A: The audio is the highest quality playable with the 3600k/s video track bitrate, so it's at 396k/s stereo (ADX audio). As of v1.0, there is not yet any way to change this to mono or a different bitrate with a user facing feature/option in the vid2dcd.bat script.</p>

<p>Q: What resolution is the video on the Sega Dreamcast? Can it be changed?</p>
<p>A: The resolution is the max, 352x240. There is not yet any way to change this with a user facing feature/option in the vid2dcd.bat script.</p>

<li>LegalADX - this program was written by me in C to do one thing, convert the audio ADX file to a new one that work with Sfdmuxapp. This is open source under the 3-BSD license and source code is provided in the Video2DreamcastDisc releases.

<li><a href=http://www.dc-swat.ru/download/dc/SFD_Player.7z>SFD_Player</a> - released all the way back in 2000, this Sega Dreamcast  program automatically plays the <code>movie/BUMPER.SFD</code> file on the disc it is burned to.</li>

<li><a href=http://cdrtools.sourceforge.net/private/cdrecord.html>MKISOFS</a> - creates the 2048 MODE 1 data video.iso file which auto-plays your video on the Sega Dreamcsast when booted with the Utopia Boot Disc. MKISOFS is a part of <a href=>, which is licensed under the ‎GNU GPL‎ and CDDL licenses.

<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_bootdisk>Utopia Boot Disc</a> - the original Sega Dreamcast backup method. It is essentially a self-bootable loader that is used to then boot the CD-R burned with the iso containing the auto playing video.</li>
